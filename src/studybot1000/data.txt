What is a system?
combination of software (and sometimes hardware) that provides a solution for a problem
combination of methods
a method that solves many problems
a method that solves one problem
Success may be measured by answering the following questions:\nDoes the project solve what it was meant to solve?\nIs it easy to maintain and administer?\nIs it scalable to meet the needs of the client?\nIs there a successful support system in place for the client?\nWas it delivered on time and ready to go?\nWas the client happy with the finished product?
Which one of the following does not measure success in the project?
If the project workers spent a lot of time on the project
If it solves the problem
If it is easy to maintain
Is it scalable
Developed by Dr Winston Royce in 1970 based on his experience developing software for spacecraft mission planning\nThe Waterfall Model consists of several phases: \nProblem Statement\nAnalysis \nDesign \nImplementation \nIntegration /Test\nMaintenance 
Why is it called the “waterfall model”?
A mistake made in one phase often requires the developer to backup and redo some of the work in the previous phase
It was created by a waterfall enthusiast
A mistake made in a past phase cannot be fixed
A mistake made in a past phase can be fixed in the phase they are in
Computer scientists have created a view of the software development process known as the ‘software development life cycle’ (SDLC)
What does SDLC stand for?
Software Development Life Cycle
Software Determiner Life Cycle
Software Development List Control
